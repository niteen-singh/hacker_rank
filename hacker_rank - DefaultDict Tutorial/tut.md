In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group A. There are m words belonging to word group B. For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.

Example

Group A contains 'a', 'b', 'a' Group B contains 'a', 'c'

For the first word in group B, 'a', it appears at positions 1 and 3 in group A. The second word, 'c', does not appear in group A, so print -1.

Expected output:

1 3
-1

Input Format

The first line contains integers, n and m separated by a space.
The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.
The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.

Output Format

Output m lines.
The ith line should contain the 1-indexed positions of the occurrences of the ith word separated by spaces.
